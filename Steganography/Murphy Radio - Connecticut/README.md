"The world’s greatest treasure isn’t always gold."
A whisper from the past, hidden in layers so deep,
Like secrets the Poneglyphs silently keep.
Buried beneath, where few dare to seek,
A tune long lost, yet dying to speak.

Unravel the mystery, follow the waves,
Only true explorers escape these caves.
Will you hear the voice history denies?
